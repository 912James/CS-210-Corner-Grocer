# CS-210-Corner-Grocer
Project 3 for SNHU CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was a c++ program used by Corner Grocer to track inventory. More specifically the program was used to track the amount of times a items on a given list where sold with the option to see individual items or the inventory list as a whole .

What did you do particularly well?
I did my best to keep the code at the requested functionality with the least amount of code I believed the program needed. This way the code could be updated as easy as possible while still being reliable. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe with more knowledge I could have added more functionality into the code with an item average cost calculator. As I stated earlier I tried to use as little code as possible to complete the project but I am sure I could've cut the code down more with some more experience. There are so many little things that can be missed and cause program failures so it's my belief that simplicity is best. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part for me was getting the code started. As new to coding as I am it feels like I am learning enlish for the first time and just forming a thought into a sentence is a project in itself. I found reaching out to my professor, YouTube and stack overflow to be very helpful resources! 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Regardlesss of the language all programming languages seem to have much in common with how the code is laid out. That being said just the experience alone is useful in starting subsequent projects. This class has been very insightful into what C++ can do and with some tweaks I can use the projects from this class as the groundwork for future projects. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program as simple as possible and I inserted inline comments so that each section of code can be quickly read and interpreted. With some tweaks and renaming this grocery program can be reused to check the item status of a sports goods store or an auto parts shop. Also, from my justory with python and java this program could be mutated to fit other languages with the change of the code syntax.
