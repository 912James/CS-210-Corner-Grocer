# CS-210-Corner-Grocer
Project 3 for SNHU CS-210


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 3 Corner Grocer is a project that is an item-tracking program that utilizes C++ and Python. 
The program had 3 requirements:
1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. For the project we were given starter code that linked C++ and Python and used a text-based input file to produce the neccessary information.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel like my overall project was created in a way where I feel confident that it was done properly, incoporated the requested functionality and met all of the requirements. I did this by creating functions to clean up my code and having main () only need a small amount of code to run properly.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
With more time and practice I would have enhanced my project by creating classes and having better functions that would be easily called from within main(). Making those changes would make the code simpler to run while being more efficient.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
While I did not use pointers in this specific project due to how challenging they are to intergrate properly, learning how to properly utilize them is essential as I continue to grow my skills as a coder. C++ has a plethora of resoruces available that with time and practice will help improve my knowledge on pointers and how to properly use them in projects as this one and bigger ones that ai create in the future.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
With many apps, websites, video games and programs using multiple languages interacting with each other the skill i found most valuable was learning how to connect C++ and Python and seeing the benefits of having two or more programs talking to each other while also working seemlessly. Learning how to utilize Python to read and write files was also extremely helpful and beneficial.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maaintainable, readable, and adaptable by creating functions in both C++ and in Python that made the code easier to read and provide the ability if the code needs to be changed in the future. Another aspect of the code that helps in creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable is adding comments with clearly written details.
